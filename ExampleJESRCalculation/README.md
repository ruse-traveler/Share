### Description
This set of python scripts illustrates how to calculate
the charged jet JES/R.

Currently, the only example here makes use of the PODIO
interface, so it's recommended to run this in the eic-
shell.

If you pester me enough, I might be able to put together
a pure Uproot + awkward array example...
